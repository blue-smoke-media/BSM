**ADD VIDEO BACKGROUND [PLEASE humor me for right now].

**Add the CTA "Contact Us" with the colors, including the hover. [to the absolute right]

**BreadCrumbs - reduce size and add JS to function correctly

**How Can A Custom Website Design Help My Business?

The green diamonds are in spans. Evidently, that isn't accepted. This is the one part that for some reason or another has kicked my ass!  I am assuming you will use a list with an <i></i> for the diamond.  When reduced to mobile, the image HAS TO BE ON TOP of the bullet points, please.

**On "Our Standard Features" and "Our Services",  I know there is a way to make the boxes all even regardless of the amount of text in them.  I'm pretty sure it's in flexBox, but I'm unable to make it work properly.   Would you please try?

**Pricing Plans & Packages
     The prices are commented out on each pkg. The JS needs to be written so the prices toggle between the monthly and yearly

    When the yearly and monthly are toggled, the is a pink rectangular box that appears for a moment and then disappears....got any idea????
