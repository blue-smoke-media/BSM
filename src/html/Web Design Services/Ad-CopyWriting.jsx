          <span className="orange">1. Step back from your site.</span> Many site
          owners are too close to their products to describe them effectively.
          You can begin to lose sight of what makes your product different, and
          how you can describe how they will benefit someone. While you may
          think that a certain feature is extremely obvious and needs no
          description, someone who has never seen the same product may not
          understand this. <span>Blue Smoke Digital Media</span> will help you
          take that “step back” and analyze your site making recommendations
          about any potential need for change.

          purchases because they{" "}

            believe the item will make them feel better or make their lives
            easier.
          </Link>{" "}
          How can your product or service benefit someone? Make a list of the
          different benefits that your product can offer and then use these
          points in your copy.
