        the process of enhancing your website with the goal of increasing your
        visibility in the top search engines when specific keywords or phrases
        are searched for. The overall process involves a variety of aspects
        including keyword analysis and selection, website optimization for
        optimal search engine positioning, search engine crawler inclusion,
        creating and submitting directory listings , link popularity enhancement
        and ongoing campaign reporting and maintenance. The end result is that
        people will be able to easily find your website when searching for

        <span>Organic or Natural Keyword Optimization</span> is critical to
        ensuring your site is organized properly and that your content, (we
        suggest at least 250 words of rich content), reflects your target
        keyword phrases accurately. Relevant content is key for top search
        engine rankings. We start with Title and Meta Tags and work through the
        on-page text content and layout and internal linking of your web pages
        to ensure proper page formatting and keyword relevancy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organic Search Engine Optimization will increase the likelihood that
        your site will show up on a search for a particular keyword. Since over
        time a substantial amount of a client's site traffic will result from
        search engines, optimization should be looked at as a long-term
        investment.
