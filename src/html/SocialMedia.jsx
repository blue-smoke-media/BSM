          Social Media: Why It Is 100% Essential (and How to Use It Well)
        </h1>
        <p>
          Social media is a form of electronic communication designed to let
          people share content quickly, efficiently, and in real-time. While
          many people access social media through smartphone apps, this
          communication tool started with computers, and social media can refer
          to any internet communication tool that allows users to broadly share
          content and engage with the public.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media">Wikipedia</a>,
          “Social media are interactive computer-mediated technologies that
          facilitate the creation or sharing of information, ideas, career
          interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and
          networks.” They go on further to say, ”Social media can help to
          improve an individual's sense of connectedness with real or 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online">online</a>
           communities and can be an effective communication (or 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing">marketing</a>) tool
          for corporations, entrepreneurs, non-profit organizations, advocacy
          groups, political parties, and governments.”

          In today’s society, word of mouth IS digital. Think about the
          questions you constantly ask about products, services or businesses;
          your customers are asking the SAME questions. Addressing these common
          points of confusion could be your key to converting casual website
          visitors into new clients. The biggest question of all though, is
          whether potential customers will WANT to visit your website based on
          your social media presence. So, start or join a conversation, and
          participate with the idea in mind that you can achieve a significant
          influence. Take a hold and grow your brand by taking hold of your
          social media presence!
        </p>
        <p>
          “How can a social media presence help my business?” Social media is
          used to market your products, promote your brand, connect to current
          and possible new clients, and help foster new business. Again, you ask
          “How?” Let’s start with some statistics that will help you to
          understand the importance of social media marketing. In fact, it is so
          important that 97% of marketers are using social media and 
          <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2013/05/19/study-78-of-salespeople-using-social-media-outsell-their-peers/#715beee67c32">
            78% of salespeople outsell their peers
          </a>
           simply by using social media for their business.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, not all businesses are aware of the benefits of social media
          marketing. In fact, 
          <a href="http://stlblackbiz.com/small-businesses-arent-readily-using-social-media/">
            50% of small businesses aren’t using social media
          </a>
           to promote their business and an additional 25% don’t plan to use
          social media in the future. There is clearly a large disconnect
          between those who are seeing the benefits of social media and those
          struggling to get started.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might ask, “How will my business benefit from an active social
          media presence?” Here are just three of the ways your business could
          benefit:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            ◆ Social Media can be a valuable tool as profiles can provide
            general information and updates about your business.
          </li>

          <li>
            ◆ Businesses can interact and engage with current and future clients
            in a community like setting.
          </li>

          <li>
            ◆ Your businesses social profiles can also help improve your organic
            SEO for your website.
          </li>
        </ul>

          </a>{" "}
          of 180Fusion, stated that “If small businesses want to compete, if
          they want to level the playing field with their competitors, if they
          don’t want to lose ground, they have to be participating in social
          media.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The world of digital tech is a constantly moving landscape with social
          media marketing seeming to move even faster. And because it’s so fast
          moving it can be tough to figure out how each piece of the puzzle fits
          with your small or corporate business. Social Media Engagement remains
          an essential ingredient of business and marketing success. To win over
          audiences in a world increasingly dominated by instantaneous social
          media and the 24-hour news cycle, the power of connecting with people
          can be the difference between success and failure.
        </p>
