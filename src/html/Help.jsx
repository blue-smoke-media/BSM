            <p>
              No business is too small for a website, but creating and
              maintaining a website can be daunting. How do you know what to put
              on your website? What color should the buttons be? What does “SEO”
              mean? With so many questions, it can be difficult to focus on what
              matters.

              “Decisions to buy or not buy from a company have increasingly less
              to do with place, packaging, or promotion and almost everything to
              do with how much your friends, family, and even strangers provide
              online assurance that the product or service is worth the cost.”

              We interact with friends, family, and colleagues largely through
