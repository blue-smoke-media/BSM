          Design will take an ordinary experience and turn it into a powerful
          experience, one that is not quickly forgotten. Leaving this kind of
          impression on your customer, is an integral key to success. Good
          design has power; it may be hard to measure, but there are ways to see
          the value inherent in purposeful, targeted and personal design.

                  got to show, and it’s got to be clear. If people can recognize
                  and differentiate you from the crowd, you’re going to do
                  better than the crowd.

                  <span>Remembrance - </span>If they can’t remember who you were
                  or what you were about, your chances of doing business with
                  them again are probably slim. Good design will make an
                  impression on your customers or clients. They won’t forget
                  about you.

                <Link to="/article/12">good design</Link> is apparent to almost
                everyone. They might not know exactly why, but they know when
                something looks good. People respect design because it shows
                that you care about how you look. It’s an easy connection to
                make that if you care about how you look, you care just as much
                about your products, services and ideas. People will see that
                and respect you.

                <span>Trust - </span>Respect leads to Trust and Trust is
                priceless! Design plays a very important part in establishing
                Trust with the people you work with. It’s not the only part, but
                it’s something that is often overlooked as unnecessary, or not
                worth the expense. It is worth it; you want to give your client
                the right impression.

                An appropriate brochure, business card, logo or any printed
                media is a necessity when it comes to spreading the word about
                your company. And “appropriate” might mean the use of a burlap
                envelope, a tipped-on photo, or a cinnamon-stick binding — it
                all depends on your industry and your objectives. We get to know
