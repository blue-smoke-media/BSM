        <h1>Website Logos</h1>
        <p>
          Websites without a logo look incomplete — and miss on an important
          "branding" opportunity — while logos that do not look professional
          simply convey a poor impression.
        </p>
        <p>
          With your professionally-designed logo on every page, your customers
          will know that they've arrived at your website, your website will look
          uniform and consistent, and your logo will remind potential new
          customers of your company — on every page.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you already have a <a href="/html/article.html?id=4">logo</a>, we
          can prepare it for usage on the Web, helping to bring your offline
          message and branding to your online presence — and identify your
          website to your customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We specialize in aesthetic, one-of-a-kind logos that say what you do.
          We use <a href="/team">state-of-the-art graphics programs</a> to
          translate your logo into Web formats, cutting down on "download" time
          as much as possible while retaining the quality of the image.
        </p>
        <p>
          If <span>Blue Smoke Digital and Printed Media</span> is designing your
          website, we can design it around the look and feel of your logo,
          arriving at a cohesive balance and color scheme that just "looks
          right".
