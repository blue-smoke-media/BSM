          One of the toughest design projects is reducing the identity of an
          organization to a single symbol. Many companies are complex systems of
          individuals and entities working toward a variety of goals. Our
          identities are the result of a process that remains flexible while at
          the same time building a brand. Looking for a unique image to
          represent your corporate identity? Or do you just need to modify your
